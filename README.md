# Language Distribution in the United States

## API call to layers built with census data: [Live Site](http://us-languages2013.fun/)

This application was built by adding 2013 US Census data on languages spoken in the US to a GeoJson file as a property.  This GeoJson was then used to build a layer in Mapbox in order to accomplish the display.
