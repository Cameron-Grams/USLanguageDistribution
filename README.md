# Language Distribution in the United States

## As of 2013: [Live Site](https://us-languages2013.fun/)

This is a graphic representation of how many people speak various languages in the United States.  The 2013 US Census data on languages spoken in the US was added to a GeoJson file as a property, which was then used to build a layer for the MapBox API in order to render the display.
